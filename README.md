# Martians Technology Dictionary

Summary
-----------
One of the biggest problems in Intelligence studies is the association of semantics and syntax. Indeed, the field spans various domains and industries like physics, computer science, mathmatics, and psychology. Across these different disciplines words often have different meanings. As a result, interdisciplinary communication is difficult, creating a barrier to effective  collaboration. Martian's Technology Dictionary is my working solution to the problem.

The MTD.csv file is a working database of terms, definitions, and citations relating to computer science, technology, physics, engineering, and mathmatics. The two python files are tools for building and retrieving information from the database. MTD_2.csv is an updated and organized version.
